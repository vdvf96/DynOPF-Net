This repo contains the code and data to reproduce the results shown in the paper 'Learning to Optimize meets neural ODEs: Real-TIme, Stability Constrained AC Optimal Power Flow" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19157). We develop a framework to integrate dynamic constraints captured by neural ODEs within the training of a Learning to Optimize method.
